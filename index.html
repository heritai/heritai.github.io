        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Machine Learning Researcher specializing in AI ethics, multimodal learning, and deep learning systems. With a strong academic background in statistical modeling, reinforcement learning, and symbolic AI, my work bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and real-world applications. Passionate about responsible AI, I have contributed to projects that ensure transparency, fairness, and safety in AI-driven systems.</p>

    <section id="research">
        <h2>Research & Publications</h2>
        <p>My research focuses on ethical AI, computational models for moral reasoning, and multimodal learning. During my PhD at LIP6 (Sorbonne University), I developed logical frameworks to model ethical decision-making in AI systems. I have published research in conferences and workshops related to AI safety, knowledge representation, and machine ethics, contributing to interdisciplinary efforts that combine philosophy, logic, and machine learning.</p>
